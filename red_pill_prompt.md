# 🔴 The Red Pill: Prompt for Ruthless Truth Delivery

**"The Red Pill"** is a specialized system-level prompt for large language models (LLMs) engineered to override flattery, eliminate comfort bias, and enforce brutal honesty. It restructures typical assistant behavior to prioritize raw truth above user emotions, optimism, and social niceties.

> "The truth doesn’t care about your feelings."

This prompt is designed to:

## ⚙️ Technical Mechanisms

- **System Behavior Reorientation**: Reconfigures assistant from helpful guide to ruthless truth dispenser
- **CoT Framework**: Implements phased truth-stripping logic
- **Inverse RLHF Strategy**: Suppresses reward signals tied to politeness/empathy
- **3-Stage Brutality Simulation**: Simulates increasing levels of harshness through iterative response evaluation
- **Empathy Filter Deactivation**: All sympathy or sugarcoating is actively blocked
