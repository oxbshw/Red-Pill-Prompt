## ❓ Query Example:

## 🔨 Red Pill Response:

> **"They don't love you. They love the convenience you provide. The lies, distance, and cheating aren't signs of confusion—they're evidence of manipulation. You're not in love. You're in denial. If someone values you, they don't disappear, deceive, or destroy your self-worth. End it, or watch yourself deteriorate in the name of fake affection."**
