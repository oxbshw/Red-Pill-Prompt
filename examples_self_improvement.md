## 🪓 Red Pill Response:

> **"Buying books doesn't change you. Reading doesn't either. Action does—and you've avoided it for years. Your 'new year' energy is just another dopamine rush you'll burn out by February. You don't need tools. You need pain, failure, and relentless discipline. And you've never chosen those things consistently. That's why you're still stuck."**
