---

## 🚨 Query Example:

## 💣 Red Pill Response:

> **"You're not ready. You're deluded. 9 out of 10 startups fail within the first 3 years, and most never break even. You don't want to be free—you want to escape accountability. Your plan isn't a plan, it's a fantasy with no model, no data, and no discipline. The market doesn't care about your dreams. It will crush you if you're not prepared. And guess what? You're not."**
